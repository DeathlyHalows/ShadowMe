# ShadowMe
ShadowMe is an AI based extension tool that will block all potential trackers. It uses AI to clear your device footprints such as cookies, mouse pointer movement, browser headers, device specs such as screen size, width, etc. 
#  ShadowMe — Your AI-Powered Privacy Cloak

> **ShadowMe** is a web-based AI privacy companion that protects your online identity by generating synthetic decoy data in real time.  
> It uses **AI + Encryption + Web Technologies** to confuse trackers, mask your digital fingerprint, and reduce your exposure on the internet.

##  Overview

Every time you browse, your digital fingerprint — device type, location, resolution, cookies, behavior — is tracked and profiled.  
Traditional tools (VPNs, AdBlockers) hide IPs, but not *who you are* online.

**ShadowMe** introduces a new layer of defense:
> **AI-driven synthetic identity generation** that cloaks your real data behind intelligent, realistic decoys.

##  Key Features

| Pillar | Feature |
|--------|----------|
|**AI/ML** | Learns browsing patterns and generates realistic "shadow" identities that evolve over time. |
|**Cybersecurity** | Uses AES-256 local encryption to protect real user data before any processing. |
|**Web Application** | Interactive dashboard showing exposure score, trackers blocked, and current shadow persona. |
|**Innovation** | First system to actively mislead data trackers with synthetic yet believable profiles. |

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Capture:**  
   ShadowMe reads non-sensitive browser metadata (resolution, OS, timezone, etc.).
2. **AI Behavior Model:**  
   ML learns usage patterns and predicts realistic alternative “shadow” identities.
3. **Decoy Generation:**  
   System modifies outbound metadata to mimic synthetic personas.
4. **Encryption:**  
   All user data is locally encrypted — nothing sensitive is ever uploaded.
5. **Visualization:**  
   Web dashboard shows live exposure and protection metrics.

## 🧪 Demo (Proof of Concept)

1. Visit a “Tracker Test” page (e.g., demo.local/test).  
2. Observe visible metadata (IP, user-agent, etc.).  
3. Activate **Shadow Mode** in ShadowMe → metadata changes dynamically.  
4. Dashboard updates:  
   - Exposure Score ↓  
   - Shadow Persona generated (e.g., *Traveler-09*)  
   - Trackers blocked shown live.

## 🛡️ Security Design

- End-to-end AES encryption before data leaves browser.  
- Randomized metadata ensures trackers cannot correlate sessions.  
- No raw data stored on any server.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Mobile support (Android/iOS privacy layer)  
- Shadow network (community-generated decoy profiles)  
- Integration with browser fingerprint APIs  
- On-device AI model for total offline privacy
