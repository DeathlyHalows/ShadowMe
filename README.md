## 🏆 Hackathon Submission

This project is a submission for the **HackaThrone 2025** hackathon.  
**Pillars:** Artificial Intelligence, Web Development, Cybersecurity, Innovations   
**Team Name:** RockStar ByteSquads

**Team Members:**
- **Shyam Ganesh V** — Lead Developer & Architect  
- **Viswas M** — Frontend & AI systems
- **Shyam Sundar M** - Frontend
- **Jagadhishwar** - Frontend

## 🚨 The Problem

Every click, post, and message contributes to your **digital fingerprint**.  
Meanwhile, the rise of AI and web tracking has blurred the line between **authentic identity** and **algorithmic profiling**.

Users lack control over:
- How they are digitally represented and interpreted  
- How AI perceives their tone, intent, and reasoning  
- How much of their **digital self** belongs to them  

---

## 💡 The Vision — “ShadowMe”

**ShadowMe** lets you create your **intelligent digital shadow** — a version of yourself that learns your communication style, thinking patterns, and personality traits.

You can:
- **Train it** with your own text samples  
- **Chat** with it in real time  
- **Enable Mirror Mode** — where your AI shadow constructively challenges your thoughts and reasoning  

It’s both a **privacy shield** and a **self-reflective AI companion**.
